# proton-java-samples
Samples for domino-db for Java

Please put domino-db-0.0.5.jar and domino-db-0.0.5-javadoc.jar into the "lib" folder to make this sample work.

Also, you need to put your proton application certificates into a subfolder in this project and reference them in App.java 
at the documented lines.
Also, please make sure to update the proton hostname, nsfname etc. in App.java to your environment.

Code is provided as-is. You get what you get, so don't get upset.

Cheers,
